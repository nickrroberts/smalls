Little projects for learning/fun. Here's an index with demo links:

### [3t](https://nickrroberts.github.io/smalls/3t/)
Tic tac toe in the browser!

### [battleship](https://nickrroberts.github.io/smalls/battleship/)
Battleship in the browser! It's a little unwieldy on mobile right now and I have a TODO to make it better. But desktop is pretty awesome. 

### [calculator](https://nickrroberts.github.io/smalls/calculator/)
A simple calculator written in vanilla js!

### [cube](https://nickrroberts.github.io/smalls/cube/)
Playing around with 3D transforms.

A basic landing page made using flexbox...üëç

### [grid](https://nickrroberts.github.io/smalls/grid/)

### [rps](https://nickrroberts.github.io/smalls/rps/)
Rock Paper Scissors in the browser.

### [sketch](https://nickrroberts.github.io/smalls/sketch/)
A simple way to draw pixel art on a grid. You can also specify how fine-grained the canvas should be.

### [weather](https://nickrroberts.github.io/smalls/weather/)
Ah, the obligatory weather app that hits an API and displays stuff in the DOM. Good chance to mess around with async and await. Built a little favoriting system for locations with localStorage as well!
